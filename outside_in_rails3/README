rails new outside_in_example -m http://jruby.org

vi Gemfile
    group :development, :test do
      gem 'rspec-rails', '>=2.0.1'
      gem 'cucumber-rails'
      gem 'capybara'
    end

bundle
rails generate rspec:install
rails generate cucumber:install --capybara
rake db:migrate
export CUCUMBER_FORMAT=pretty   # or config/cucumber.yml
rake cucumber
# fails

rails generate rspec:model story
vi spec/models/story_spec.rb 
# test-drive development of the model
# we'll take a short cut and implement with scaffold
rails generate scaffold story title:string content:text
rake db:migrate
rake cucumber # still fails, need to make homepage refer to story list

vi config/routes.rb
  root :to => "stories#index"
rake cucumber # still fails
  
rm public/index.html
rake cucumber # first scenario passes!

to address the next failure, we'll edit the controller
modify the create method:
        format.html { redirect_to(@story, :notice => 'Story was successfully created.') }
change @story to root_path

Now we've fixed one error, but the scenario stil fails.  We need to edit the index page so the description is not listed there.
